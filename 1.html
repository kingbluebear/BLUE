    <h2>Tottenham</h2>
    <p>Tottenham Hotspur Football Club [2][3] is a football club in Tottenham. Tottenham Hotspur Stadium has replaced White Hart Lane, the club's home stadium, since April 2019 to build a new stadium on the same site. Their training ground is in the Bulls Cross' Hassper Way in Enfield District, London. The club is owned by ENIC Group. Tottenham played at home for the first time in white shirts and navy shorts since the 1898-99 season. The club's emblem has a Latin motto, "To Dare Is Do to Do," with cocaine standing on football.

Founded in 1882, Tottenham won the FA Cup for the first time in 1901, making it the only non-league club since the football league was formed in 1888. Tottenham is the first club to achieve league and FA Cup double in the 20th century, winning both competitions in the 1960-61 season. After successfully defending the FA Cup in 1962, he became the first English club to win the UEFA Cup Winners Cup in 1963.[4] He also became the first winner of the 1972 UEFA Cup and became the first British club to win two major European trophies. They collected at least one major trophy in the 60 years from the 1950s to the 2000s, the only achievement Manchester United has achieved.[5][6] Spurs won two league titles, eight FA Cups, four League Cups, seven FA Community Shields, one European Cup Winners Cup and two UEFA Cups. Tottenham also finished runner-up in the UEFA Champions League 2018-19. They maintain a long-standing rivalry with nearby club Arsenal, which competes with North London Derby.
